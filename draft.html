<h1>Mapping Diversity in England/Wales based on Country of Birth</h1>
<p>This interactive map illustrates the diversity score of each of the 330 local authorities in England/Wales based on the  <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census">census</a> data of country of birth in 2021. Although diversity is typically defined by <i>ethnicity</i>, I chose to use <i>country of birth</i> instead, because I have found ethnicity can at times be subjective and ambiguous. For example, as a Malaysian living in UK, am I a Chinese or other Asian? Therefore, I chose to use country of birth as the proxy measure for diversity, given that it is a rather objective construct besides several controversial cases.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the country of birth are divided into 13 categories for the calculation of the diversity score, with higher score indicating more heterogenous, compared to the lower score for more homogenous group of people, which are usually people born in the UK in this analysis (see details on the calculation at the bottom of the page).</p>
<p>On top of the diversity mapping, you could click into each local authority to further investigate the proportion of people born in UK and the other 12 regions. This diversity mapping may also provide insight into where immigrants normally settle after coming to UK. As expected, London and other major cities like Manchester are populated by people from around the world. However, there would be more nuances aside from the overview of the map. I will continue to investigate. Meanwhile, do let me know how you think or what you have found out after playing with the map.</p>

<p>The diversity score is calculated following the formula of entropy of information theory, which has been used in diversity research for ethnicity. It takes into account of the proportion of all the groups present in a local authority rather than just simply using the proportion of the majority group, in this case born in UK as the proxy. The lowest score is 0, meaning that only one group of people are present, while the maximum score for 13 categories, as in the current analysis, is , when all of the grou If a </p>
